#### Installing
```
sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms git iw
cd ~
mkdir antenna_driver
cd antenna_driver
git clone https://github.com/morrownr/8821cu-20210916.git
cd 8821cu-20210916
sudo ./install-driver.sh
```

Will show:
```
Running module version sanity check.
 - Original module
   - No original module exists within this kernel
 - Installation
   - Installing to /lib/modules/5.15.0-1070-raspi/updates/dkms/
```
### Editing options
I didn't change anything, it worked out the box, may be possible to improve performance if needed.
```
nano /etc/modprobe.d/8821cu.conf
```

#### After install
After install and rebooting, the device will show and can be used in a network connection profile.
```
rpi@rpi-desktop:~$ nmcli d
DEVICE                   TYPE      STATE                   CONNECTION
wlx1cbfce2684be          wifi      connected               wlx1cbfce2684be-Vodafone-1A49
```

Created the following connection profile `wlx1cbfce2684be-Vodafone-1A49.nmconnection`:
```
[connection]
id=wlx1cbfce2684be-Vodafone-1A49
uuid=96243c6e-92c6-4bb3-a9f3-ff28b5aa8397
type=wifi
interface-name=wlx1cbfce2684be
autoconnect-priority=10

[wifi]
mode=infrastructure
ssid=Vodafone-1A49

[wifi-security]
auth-alg=open
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
psk=<password>

[ipv4]
route-metric=100
method=auto
addresses=192.168.0.197/24

[ipv6]
addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
method=auto

[proxy]
```

### Handling fallbacks and routes with NetworkManager
We can keep both connections running on `wlan0` and `wlx1cbfce2684be`, they just can't have the same IP. I want the behaviour to be use `wlx1cbfce2684be` when it is available, and `wlan0` when not. Achieved this with 2 parameters in the connection profiles:
- `ipv4.route-metric=100` - We want a lower value for the preferred one.
- `connection.autoconnect-priority=10` - We want a higher value for the preferred one.
Tested this and when the antenna is disconnected, that connection goes down, and `wlan0` takes over.
Antenna connection is currently set to `192.168.0.197`.
The VPN on `tun0` goes through the default route, so as long as one connection is active the VPN stays online.
