In 2024 I bought a [Bambu Lab A1 mini](https://eu.store.bambulab.com/de/products/a1-mini-de?variant=53687077372252&srsltid=AfmBOopoGYvPMDh-c0Fb66Z2q_L9TDGdfamtqXGMOfNUWpJAezwZpcXF) for â‚¬200. It comes fully assembled and I have found it to be an amazing tool to have around, far better than the 3D printers that were available when I was at university in 2016.

The printer was bought for other purposes, but it has been useful for printing accessories and mounts for the Create 3 robot. There is a library of mounts in the [Create 3 Docs](https://iroboteducation.github.io/create3_docs/hw/print_sensor_mounts/), but not for the devices I am using.

The faceplate and internal cargo bay of the Create 3 robot feature a 12mm grid of "3mm diameter" mounting holes, though I believe they are more like 3.2mm.

The create 3 robot comes with mounting holes on the top in a 12mm grid and "3mm" holes, though I believe they are actually slightly larger.
When printing accessories, I print with holes of 3.5mm diameter and use various M3 Screws, Nuts and Washers to assemble.
