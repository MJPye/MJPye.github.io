# Hi

I'm Matt, an engineer currently living in Berlin.

For the last 5 years, I've worked in tech startups, mostly on Robotics, but also a lot of Linux and Automation/Infrastructure ðŸ¤–

I decided to take some of that learning a make a robotics project for in my apartment.

This blog shows how I build a robot that I can control remotely through the browser.

The Robot can also navigate the apartment on it's own!
